# Week 2 Basic Portfolio Challenge
Simple Portfolio Using CSS, HTML, and Javascript 

## Introduction
A key part of an early developer's career is creating a portfolio that displays their projects. Adjacent to a professional resume, a develper's portfolio allows emplyers to gain insight to a prospective employee's skills, creativty and background. It offers developers a chance to share their work with new and existing clients. It is a pivotal part of getting your foot in the door as a junior developer. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
