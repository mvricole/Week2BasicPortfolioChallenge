          <center><h2>Aspiring Software Developer â€¢ Creative Professional â€¢ Mental Health Advocate</h2></center><br>
          I am a 30 year old, Filipino-American creative passionate about producing AUTHENTIC, genuine, and engaging applications for you and your brand. 
          I have been creating content since I was 12 years old and have since then created projects spanning from portraits for campaigns and short form content for brands and listings.
          I have just recently earned my full stack development web development certificate from the University of California, Irvine in December 2022. 
        </p>
        <p>
          My career background in grant writing and public health policy guide me to be data informed and encouraged by the concept of self-efficacy, building the belief in your audienceâ€™s propensity to sucessfully engage with your website. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I am inspired by applications that are efficient and visually appealing to create a connection between you and your target audience.           
          I am seeking opportunities to create applications that improve and advance accessibility to mental health resources or other community service operations.
